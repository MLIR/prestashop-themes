            <p>This theme of Eveprest is designed for fashion stores. It comes with a module that can expose your
                products
                to more people.
                What’s cool, you won’t have to make any efforts at all ‒ customers will do the job themselves.
                The module lets customers unite their favorite products into collections and share them in social media
                accounts afterwards.</p>

            <p>Eveprest is an advanced theme for an electronics store. In a single step, you can set a discount for
                items of
                a certain category, manufacturer and with specific attributes. Due to sale badges and cut prices,
                discounted
                items will stand out among others.
                The tool also allows you to create product bundles and promos with fixed terms. Each promo can have its
                own
                page.</p>

            <p>Make the most of your furniture promotion with this theme. It’s nice to see how a certain item looks on
                its
                own, but it’s much more helpful to see how it fits into the interior.
                This is what LookBook provides. The module allows you to show interior pictures with furniture pieces.
                Each
                piece is marked with a hotpoint.
                Once customers click on the hotpoint, they can see a pop-up block with more details</p>

            <p>If you sell spare parts online, Eveprest has a special solution for you. It comes with an advanced filter
                that makes on-site search accurate and quick as lightning.
                To find the right item, buyers can use maximum filters at once.
                Items can be filtered by the type, size, brand, occasion, color, price, and many other parameters.</p>

            <p>This theme will come in handy for companies selling a single product. Thanks to integration of 360 view
                module, customers can see the item from any angle.
                They can rotate its image with a mouse on a desktop and touch screen on a mobile device.
                To facilitate the shopping process, the theme has a module allowing buyers to check out in a single
                step.</p>
