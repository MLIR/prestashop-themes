<h3>TM Search 1.0.5</h3>
<p>This module allows you you to configure your shop’s search features. It has an Ajax search (which allows to display a list of results from the moment your customers type a few letters into the search bar, right under the search bar) and Instant search (which allows to display a list of results from the moment your customers type a few letters into the search bar, directly within your shop’s main content area).</p>
<p class="alert alert-warning"><span>Instant Search may be disabled by default, because visitors are not always used to have their whole content changed just entering a few letters in the shop’s search bar. Therefore, use with caution.</span></p>
<p>It also provides a possibility to set the additional product information display (description/price/manufacturer, etc.). All the module settings are available in main admin panel.</p>

<h4>Module configuration</h4>
